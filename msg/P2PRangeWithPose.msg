# This message represents a single range-only reading from a pair of devices 
# (emitter and receiver). 
# This message is  not appropriate for laser scanners or other non pair 
# to pair range sensor. See the LaserScan message if you are working with 
# a laser scanner and Range if you are working with non pair single active 
# ranger.

# In pair to pair range-only sensors the emitter sensor is the one which makes a 
# ranging request to another receiver device.
